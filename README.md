# Scrap from nothing

Our submission for the Ludum Dare #45, more details [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/ld45-scrap-from-nothing).

## How to play 

Scrap from nothing is a 1v1 game based on 2 phases.

Try to find scrap on the map to upgrade your robot. Pick up item one by one, and go find a factory to add the item to your robot.

You can apply 1 shield, 1 propulsor and 2 weapons on each robot. To assemble items, go in the from the factory and press left or right fire keys (C & V for player 1, K & L for player 2).

You can also disassemble all the items installed on your robot by using a bin.

When the timer is over, you just need to defeat your opponent by shooting him.

Good Luck & Have Fun !
